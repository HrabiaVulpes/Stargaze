Shattered world

Long ago mages wanted to connect multiple worlds, to conquer those less developed and gain their resources.
At the beginning it was a great idea and soon gates connected multiple worlds creating network of portals.
But reality can only be stretched so far - one day space snapped, all connected worlds became one.
Shattered into pieces flowing in sea of pure magic whole continents scattered as mere islands.

Some mages learned from their mistakes, some will try to reclaim their old power and wealth.
World comes into new era, and darkness creeps through the sea of magic, slowly but surely nibbing at worlds themselves.
